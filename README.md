# OpenLessor Frontend POC using ReasonReact and Tailwind CSS

Using the following third party tools and libraries:
- Parcel
- Light icons

Written using ReScript and React. This is a work in progress. In it's current state, it should not be used by anyone.

Documentation on actaully running the POC coming soon.

## Plans for Frontend POC
- Hardware Cloud Equipment Rental
- Apartment / Room Rental
- Cloud Server (with multiple billing types; such as per minute, per month)

## Vision

OpenLessor will be an open source project for lease management, and subscription management. It will offer multiple billing types based on time units such as minutes, days, weeks, and months. I am currently working on this in my freetime and my hope is that the project will slowly progress over time.
